		"description": "Traditionally, historians tended to think Ancient Egypt was the site of cat domestication. However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave excavated in Cyprus contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known felineâ€“human association significantly. The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the African wildcat, rather than present-day domestic cats.",
